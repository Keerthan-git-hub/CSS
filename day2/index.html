    <p class="proj1"><b>Network Instrusion Detection using Supervised  Machine Learning Technique with Feature Selection </b></p>
    <p class="proj2"> A novel supervised machine learning system is developed to classify network traffic wheather it is malicious. To find best model considering detection success rate, combination of supervised learning algorthim and feature selection method have been used. Through this study, it is found that Artifical Neural Network (ANN) based machine learning with wrapper feature selection outperform support vector machine (SVM) technique while classifying network traffic.</p>
    <p class="proj3"><b>Time Supply Chain Tracking Enhancing Transparency in product Tracking from Maker to Consumer </b></p>
    <p class="proj4">  In today's gobalized economy, efficient and transparent supply chain management has become crucial for businesses to ensure the timely delivery of products and maintain consumer trust. However, the lack of real-time tracking and transparency by providing end to end visibility of product movement, ensuring that all parties involed in the supply chain from manufacture to consumers haave access to accurate, up-to-date information about the status and location of products. The system utilizies cutting-edge technologies such as IOT, blockchains, and cloud computing to track products in real time and provide secure, immutable data records.</p>
